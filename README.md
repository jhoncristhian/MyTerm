# MyTerm
This is a lightweight C++ terminal under active development. Despite its early stage, it runs smoothly and mimics classic Linux terminals with a minimal look. It aims for fast performance, cross-platform support, and future customization. Already stable, it serves as a solid base for improvements. Contributions are welcome!
